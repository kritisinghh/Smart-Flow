# ðŸš¦ Smart Flow: Intelligent Traffic Signal Control using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

Smart Flow is an AI-powered traffic control system that uses Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) to optimize traffic light timing across multiple intersections. The aim is to reduce average travel time, vehicle waiting time, COâ‚‚ emissions, and fuel consumption in urban environments.

It leverages the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) simulator and a custom reinforcement learning environment to train agents that make intelligent decisions in real-time.

# Project Goals

- Reduce congestion at intersections using Reinforcement Learning.
- Optimize environmental and energy metrics: COâ‚‚ emissions and fuel usage.
- Provide a simulation-based testing environment via SUMO.
- Build a scalable, multi-agent system applicable to smart city traffic networks.
